# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing towards this project.

We accept contributions via pull requests on [Github](https://github.com/kamalkhan/download).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - Check the code style with ``$ composer cs-check`` and fix it with ``$ composer cs-fix``.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch may not be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any changes** - Make sure the `README.md` and the `docs` are reflected with the update/change.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One PR per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Squash commit history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
